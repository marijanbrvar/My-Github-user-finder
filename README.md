## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link]()

## Getting Started

**When you open the application from the above link, you will be able to add a task to the default job list** immediately
**Otherwise, you can create a new list in the most left input field and add a new task to the current list.**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- Chrome browser
- Node v14.XX >
- npm (usually already installed with current node version)

### Setup
To run code locally, please follow steps belove
1. `git@github.com:marijanbrvar/My-Github-user-finder.git && cd My-Github-user-finder`
2. run `npm install`
3. then run `npm run start`

webpack will automatically open the default browser, and you can start using the ToDo web app. All data is stored locally, which means that all your job/tasks will stay present in the browser after the refresh.
